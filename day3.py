#My goal for today is to build a treasure island where users decide the outcome of the games but in order to do that
# we will start with foundational knowledge on conditional statements:

#=======================================================================================
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
if height > 120:
    print("can ride")
else:
    print("cannot ride")
